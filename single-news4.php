							<h2>How To Store Cannabis Seeds</h2>
							<p>Cannabis seeds are the starting point for growing your own cannabis plants. They are also valuable commodities, as they can be used for breeding and creating new strains. Proper storage of cannabis seeds is essential to maintain their viability and ensure successful germination. In this blog post, we will discuss how to store cannabis seeds to keep them fresh and viable for years to come.</p>
							<p>The most important factor in storing cannabis seeds is keeping them cool. Heat can damage the seeds and reduce their viability. The ideal temperature for storing cannabis seeds is between 6°C to 8°C. A refrigerator is a good option for storing seeds, but avoid the freezer as it can damage the seeds.</p>
							<p>Moisture can also damage cannabis seeds and lead to mold growth. It is important to keep the seeds dry by storing them in an airtight container with a desiccant packet or silica gel. These packets will absorb any moisture in the container and keep the seeds dry.</p>
							<p>Light can also damage cannabis seeds, so it is important to store them in a dark place. Avoid storing seeds in clear containers or in areas with direct sunlight.</p>
							<p>It is important to label your cannabis seeds properly to avoid confusion later on. Label the container with the strain name, date of purchase or harvest, and any other relevant information such as the breeder or seed bank.</p>
							<p>Even with proper storage, cannabis seeds will lose viability over time. It is best to use them within a year or two of purchase or harvest. After that, germination rates may decrease, and it may be more difficult to get the seeds to sprout.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, proper storage of cannabis seeds is essential for maintaining their viability and ensuring successful germination. Keep them cool, dry, and in the dark, label them properly, and use them within a reasonable time frame. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your cannabis seeds will be fresh and viable for years to come, and that you will be able to grow healthy and strong cannabis plants.</p>
