							<h2>Cannabis Varieties</h2>
							<p>Cannabis, also known as marijuana, has been used for medicinal and recreational purposes for thousands of years. With the legalization of cannabis in many parts of the world, more and more people are becoming interested in the different varieties and strains of this versatile plant. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at some of the most popular cannabis varieties and what makes them unique.</p>
							<h4>Sativa</h4>
							<p>Sativa strains are known for their uplifting and energizing effects. They typically have higher levels of THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, and lower levels of CBD, the non-psychoactive compound. Sativa strains are often used during the daytime or for creative activities as they can promote focus and productivity. Some popular sativa strains include Sour Diesel, Jack Herer, and Durban Poison.</p>
							<h4>Indica</h4>
							<p>Indica strains are known for their relaxing and calming effects. They typically have higher levels of CBD and lower levels of THC, making them ideal for those seeking pain relief or a good night's sleep. Indica strains are often used in the evening or for relaxation purposes. Some popular indica strains include Purple Kush, Granddaddy Purple, and Northern Lights.</p>
							<h4>Hybrid</h4>
							<p>Hybrid strains are a combination of sativa and indica strains. They are often bred to create specific effects, such as a balanced high or a certain flavor profile. Hybrid strains can vary widely in their THC and CBD levels, making it important to research each specific strain before consuming. Some popular hybrid strains include Blue Dream, Girl Scout Cookies, and OG Kush.</p>
							<h4>CBD</h4>
							<p>CBD, or cannabidiol, is a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis. CBD strains are typically low in THC and high in CBD, making them popular for medicinal purposes such as reducing anxiety, inflammation, and seizures. CBD strains can also be used for relaxation purposes without the psychoactive effects of THC. Some popular CBD strains include Charlotte's Web, AC/DC, and Harlequin.</p>
